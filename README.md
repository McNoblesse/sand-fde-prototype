# Sand Technologies – Forward Deployed Engineer Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains my submission for the **Sand Technologies Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) Recruitment Assignment**.

The solution is a prototype **Neonatal Health Decision Support Platform** that transforms raw health datasets into actionable insights for decision-makers through interactive analytics and dashboards.

The application demonstrates:

- Executive health monitoring
- Clinical outcome analytics
- Facility capacity assessment
- Workforce analytics
- Governance monitoring
- Facility performance ranking
- Risk scoring
- Intervention prioritization
- Automated recommendations

The prototype was developed using Python and Streamlit with a modular analytics architecture.
